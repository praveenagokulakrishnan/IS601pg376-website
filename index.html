                <h3>Academic goals:</h3>
                <p>
                    I was pretty much concerned in choosing my college. Since, <a href="http://www.njit.edu/">NJIT</a> is one of the best colleges for Computing, it was more of a straight forward option. Already having a MBA degree, decided that a MS program which is an amalgamation of Business and Information systems would be more advantageous. I got a lot to say about my academic goals. From the very first day I joined NJIT, I am so delighted about being of a part of it. I want myself to have a deeper understanding of the course concepts, and imbibe the course concepts which would be more beneficial for my career. I'm more penchant in learning about Business Analytics, Web Systems and therefore I should equip thoroughly in the subjects like WebSystems Development, Data Mining, Data Analytics, Web Mining, System Analysis and Design.

                <p>
                    Everyone has a dream about their first job and so am I. The data field is blooming in today's world and there's a lot of 
                    <a href="https://www.wellcentive.com/blog/seven-top-benefits-data-analytics/">scope</a> 
                    in the field of Data Analytics. I want to see myself as a Data scientist working in a good company.

                    I am very much engrossed in Business Analytics and Systems development. I think, the knowledge that I gained from MBA and the knowledge that I'll be gaining from MS @NJIT will help me find a successful career in the field of Business Analytics. I hope to do well in subjects like Web Systems and Development, Data Mining, Web Mining etc which will enhance my knowledge and prepare me better for the corporate world.

                    Though my undergraduate major was in the Electronics and Communication Engineering I am always galvanized and penchant towards learning internet technologies. I was working as an Business Analyst - Intern in one of the major software firms where I got a chance to work on .NET technologies and a bit on the Database side.
